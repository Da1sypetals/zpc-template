CMake Warning at extern/zpc/include/zensim/zpc_tpls/CMakeLists.txt:219 (message):
  SYCL enabled but ComputeCpp_DIR and COMPUTECPP_BITCODE not all set!


CMake Warning at extern/zpc/include/zensim/zpc_tpls/CMakeLists.txt:377 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenVDB.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OpenVDB", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenVDB" with any
  of the following names:

    OpenVDBConfig.cmake
    openvdb-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenVDB" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenVDB_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenVDB" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
